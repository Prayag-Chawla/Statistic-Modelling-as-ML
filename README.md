# Descriptive Statistics
The market research team at AdRight is assigned the task to identify the profile of the typical customer for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file.

### The team identifies the following customer variables to study: 
  - product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798; 
  - gender; 
  - age, in years; 
  - education, in years; 
  - relationship status, single or partnered; 
  - annual household income ; 
  - average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week; 
  - average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week; 
  - and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape.

### Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each CardioGood Fitness treadmill product line.


In this project, I have taken a lot of statistical methods and data visualization techniques to classify the data into readable scripts, the statistcs used comprises of basic level mathematics required for descriptive analytics.


## Linear Regression
inear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.
